# Sudoku Solver
The program is written in C for high efficiency so that the sudoku puzzles can be solved quickly on lightweight hardware, such as a microcontroller.

# Notice
The project is now deprecated.  I will be remaking the program in C++ instead  for increased readability and more functionality.  A link to the C++ project will be included.  The C++ version will have better documentation (with doxygen) and more functionality.
